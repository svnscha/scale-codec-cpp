# ðŸ“¦ SCALE codec C++ implementation

This Conan package builds and packages the scale-codec-cpp library.
The library was slightly modified to make the build working as static library. Check [qdrvm/scale-codec-cpp](https://github.com/qdrvm/scale-codec-cpp) for further instructions.

## Requirements

- Conan
- CMake
- A C++ compiler
